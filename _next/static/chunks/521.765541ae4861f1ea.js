Individuals who score in this range often have a stronger self-concept, higher self-esteem, and are less vulnerable to persuasion tactics used on social media platforms (such as ads and subliminal messaging), all of which decrease their tendency to conform to the norm (Wang et al., 2012). Even though your score may be a result of healthier social media tendencies, such as having a healthy balance between your online self and \u201creal-life\u201d self, there\u2019s always room to improve!

",midRange:"Given how you performed in the survey, the feedback detected you in the middle for high levels of repercussions in using social media and low levels of repercussions in using social media. Individuals who often score at this level can maintain positive self-concept and stick to their ideas, values and goals when they are using social media during a time when they are feeling happy, confident or in a good headspace. On another note, those who experience low self-esteem, less confidence and negative self-concept will often find themselves changing their values, goals, and ideas. It has been shown that individuals who are experiencing high negative emotions will often attempt to use social media at the time of this feeling to attract social support and validation and enhance their mood. It has been proven that those who already struggle with decreased mood frequently, even if they aren\u2019t feeling low mood or low self-concept at the time, can be inclined towards social media use which can lead to further deterioration in their mood (Abbasi & Drouin, 2019).",lowRange:"Given how you performed in the survey, the feedback detects high levels of repercussions in using social media. Studies have shown evidence that excessive use of social media has negative consequences, sometimes referred to as Internet addiction, and has been related to low-self esteem symptoms (Mehdizadeh, 2010). This highlights that users are more likely to compensate for the deficiency in self-esteem by being more active on social media (Skues, Williams, & Wise, 2012). In addition, people with greater fear of negative evaluation by others are more likely to conform than others with higher social positions, such as influencers, politicians, and even marketing companies (Wright et al, 2010). It further suggests that such people have a greater chance of being susceptible to persuasion on the internet. That being said, users with lower self-concepts are inclined to view negatively about themselves and think harshly about how they may be perceived by others, enabling them to partake in troubling social media habits that may risk their mental health and wellbeing."}};function g(e,t){(null==t||t>e.length)&&(t=e.length);for(var n=0,a=new Array(t);n<t;n++)a[n]=e[n];return a}function p(e){return function(e){if(Array.isArray(e))return g(e)}(e)||function(e){if("undefined"!==typeof Symbol&&null!=e[Symbol.iterator]||null!=e["@@iterator"])return Array.from(e)}(e)||function(e,t){if(!e)return;if("string"===typeof e)return g(e,t);var n=Object.prototype.toString.call(e).slice(8,-1);"Object"===n&&e.constructor&&(n=e.constructor.name);if("Map"===n||"Set"===n)return Array.from(n);if("Arguments"===n||/^(?:Ui|I)nt(?:8|16|32)(?:Clamped)?Array$/.test(n))return g(e,t)}(e)||function(){throw new TypeError("Invalid attempt to spread non-iterable instance.\\nIn order to be iterable, non-array objects must have a [Symbol.iterator]() method.")}()}var b=function(){var e=(0,o.useState)(1),t=e[0],n=e[1],s=(0,o.useState)([0,0,0]),i=s[0],r=s[1],l=(0,o.useState)({conceptScores:"",resultMessage:""}),c=l[0],u=l[1];return(0,a.jsxs)(a.Fragment,{children:[(0,a.jsx)("header",{children:"Healthy Social Media Use Test"}),(0,a.jsx)(m,{handleBackBtn:function(){t>1&&n(t-1)},handleNextBtn:function(){t<f.numQuestions?n(t+1):t==f.numQuestions&&(!function(){for(var e,t=0,n="This test analyzes your social media across three social psychological key concepts.
